the above code needs to be broken down into multiple .py files for clarity and readability. as a default, I want a file for the UI, a file for the recording and a main, i also want a config file which stores all the variables. i the future will need addtional files like servo to move servos and object detection do object detection on images the camera takes in. Assume all the files will be in the same directory along with the toggle.sh shell script.


produce one .py file then wait for me to type next before produces the next one
