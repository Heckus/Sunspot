## Prompt:
i am using a rasberry pi and c++ can you write some code using known common libarys to control 2 servos based on angles theta and beta

## Response:
I'll help you write C++ code to control two servos on a Raspberry Pi. We'll use the WiringPi library, which is commonly used for GPIO control on Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi Dual Servo Control

Click to open code

This code provides a complete solution for controlling two servos on a Raspberry Pi. Here are the key features:

1.  Uses WiringPi library for GPIO control
2.  Implements PWM control for smooth servo movement
3.  Provides a clean class-based interface for servo control
4.  Handles angle constraints and conversion to PWM signals
5.  Includes error handling and user input validation

To use this code:

1.  First, make sure you have WiringPi installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```

2.  Connect your servos:

*   Servo 1 to GPIO 18 (Physical pin 12)
*   Servo 2 to GPIO 19 (Physical pin 35)
*   Connect power and ground appropriately

3.  Compile the code:

```bash
g++ -o servo_control servo_control.cpp -lwiringPi -lpthread
```

4.  Run the program with sudo (required for GPIO access):

```bash
sudo ./servo_control
```

You can modify the `SERVO1_PIN` and `SERVO2_PIN` constants if you're using different GPIO pins. The program will prompt you to enter angles for both servos and will continuously update their positions until you choose to exit.

Would you like me to explain any particular part of the code in more detail or help you with the hardware setup?

## Prompt:
save that, do it again without oop

## Response:
I'll create a simpler, procedural version of the servo control code without object-oriented programming.

Raspberry Pi Dual Servo Control (Non-OOP)

Click to open code

This version is more straightforward and uses simple functions instead of classes. It has the same core functionality but with a simpler structure:

1.  Basic functions for:
    *   Converting angles to PWM values
    *   Setting servo angles
    *   Initializing servos
2.  The setup remains the same:
    *   Servo 1 connects to GPIO 18 (Physical pin 12)
    *   Servo 2 connects to GPIO 19 (Physical pin 35)

To compile and run:

```bash
g++ -o servo_control_simple servo_control_simple.cpp -lwiringPi -lpthread
sudo ./servo_control_simple
```

Key differences from the OOP version:

1.  No classes or objects
2.  Direct function calls instead of method calls
3.  No encapsulation of servo state
4.  Simpler code structure but less modular
5.  Easier to understand for beginners

The program still:

*   Takes user input for both servo angles
*   Validates the input
*   Controls both servos accordingly
*   Provides feedback about the current positions
*   Centers the servos (90 degrees) before exiting

Would you like me to explain any part of this simpler version in more detail?
