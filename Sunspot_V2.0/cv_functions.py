    # How it might work:
    # 1. `main.py`: Launch a CV Process using `multiprocessing.Process`.
    # 2. Create `multiprocessing.Queue`s for input frames and output results.
    # 3. `camera_manager.py`: Instead of `get_latest_raw_frame0`, it could have a method
    #    to `put` the raw frame into the input queue for the CV process.
    # 4. `cv_functions.py (in CV process)`: Loop, get frames from input queue, process,
    #    put results (processed frame or specific data like 3D points) into output queue.
    # 5. `web_ui.py (generate_cv_stream_frames)`: Get latest result from the output queue
    #    (non-blocking get) and display it. Handle cases where queue is empty.
    # This decouples CV processing from the main camera/web server threads.
