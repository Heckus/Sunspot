## Prompt:
I'm looking to record a video, do AI object detection on it while simultaneously saving it to the root of a detected USB storage device. This is done in c++. In detail can you show me code of what that would look like, focusing on the detecting USB and saving part more, just leave the AI detection as a pseudocode. For each line can you provide detailed // comments, so I understand what is going on for each. Use OpenCV for recording the video

## Response:
I'll help you create a C++ program that combines video recording, AI object detection, and saving to a USB device.

Video Recording with AI Detection and USB Storage

Click to open code

I've created a comprehensive C++ program that handles video recording, AI object detection (as pseudocode), and USB storage detection. Let me explain the key components:

1.  USB Detection:

*   The `USBDetector` class handles USB drive detection for both Windows and Linux systems
*   On Windows, it uses the Windows API to detect removable drives
*   On Linux, it uses libudev and checks mounted devices
*   The detection is cross-platform with appropriate preprocessor directives

2.  Video Processing:

*   The `VideoProcessor` class handles video capture and recording using OpenCV
*   It includes frame capture, processing, and saving functionality
*   The AI object detection part is left as pseudocode that you can implement with your preferred model
*   Video is saved in AVI format with XVID codec for good compression and compatibility

3.  Main Program Flow:

*   Continuously checks for USB drive detection
*   Once detected, initializes camera and starts recording
*   Processes frames with optional AI detection
*   Saves the video with a timestamp in the filename
*   Handles cleanup when recording is stopped

To compile this code, you'll need:

1.  OpenCV's library
2.  On Windows: Windows SDK
3.  On Linux: libudev-dev package
4.  A C++17 compatible compiler

To modify this for your specific needs:

1.  Add your AI model implementation in the commented section of `processFrames()`
2.  Adjust video codec and parameters in `startRecording()`
3.  Modify USB detection logic if needed for specific device types
4.  Add error handling for your specific requirements

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
